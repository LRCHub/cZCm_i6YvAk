Well it ain't easy being rational
It can be hazardous, even laughable
And people die from what they're asking for
Cause what they're asking for, ain't never heard

Mother works so she could feed the youth
But does she feed the youth what they really need?
And everyone has got a point of view
But who is right or wrong remains to be seen

And go your way, and I go mine
We'll meet at the same place
But different times
We'll leave all the hardship and baggage behind
We'll see eye to eye for the first time

Now mamma said that I should take my time
But what she really meant was don't waste mine
And I stopped listening to what the crowd sang
But instead I learned to read between the lines

Well too much time, we did too much wrong
Would we change if we could recognize
That what was beautiful was there all along
Well in an envelope tied to your heart, I'd be suprised

And go your way, and I go mine
We'll meet at the same place
But different times
We'll leave all the hardship and baggage behind
We'll see eye to eye for the first time

Yea for the first time (x3)

And go your way, and I go mine
We'll meet at the same place
At different times
We'll leave all the hardship and baggage behind
We'll see eye to eye for the first time

Yea, for the first time (repeat)
